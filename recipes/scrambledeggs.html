    <h2>Desription</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a great way to start the day. I generally
        feel better whenever I eat something warm for breakfast, and this
        is, I believe, the easiest meal to prepare in the morning.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 Eggs</li>
            <li>A bit of butter (vegetable oil also works)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Chives (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm up the butter on a frying pan</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the pan</li>
            <li>Stir the eggs as they warm up</li>
            <li>Add a bit of salt, apparently the later, the better</li>
            <li>Add some chives if you want</li>
        </ol>
    <p>And here you go. Obviously you can make scrambled eggs in many
        fancier ways, but that's the way I do it.
