    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice was one of the first meals I learned to prepare
        that I was happy with. It's quick, filling, and tasty.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag of cooked, cold rice</li>
            <li>Vegetables of choice: I use carrots, onions, broccoli
                and green peas, but you can use whatever you want</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scramble your egg and put it aside</li>
            <li>Slice and dice your vegetables</li>
            <li>Warm up your vegetables on a frying pan</li>
            <li>Add the rice and sauces and stir</li>
            <li>Add the scrambled eggs at the end and stir a bit more</li>
        </ol>
    <p>And here you go. The beauty of fried rice is that you modify it
        to satisfy your needs. You can experiment with different ingredients,
        add more/different seasoning, etc.
