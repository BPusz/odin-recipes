    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe from one of my vegan friends. It's a very 
        nutritious meal that can be done quickly with a bit of practice
        and multitasking skills.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a cauliflower</li>
            <li>1 cup of red lentils</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of curry spice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of cumin</li>
            <li>200 ml of coconut milk (1/2 can)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate the cauliflower and put it in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Cook the lentils in a large pot. You need one and a half 
                cup of water for one cup of lentils. Cook them until they
                absorb the water.</li>
            <li>While the lentils are cooking, dice the onion and warm it up
                on a pan. </li>
            <li>Put the grated cauliflower on the pan, together with the spices
                and stir.</li>
            <li>When everything is done, put the cauliflower in the pot with lentils.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk and mix everything together.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>And here you go. This is the most complicated recipe out of the ones I posted. It is not
        really possible to mess it up, though. At worst, the kitchen might look a little messy after you're done.
